**  Recommendation #7
**    Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1-4 weeks of starting 
**    opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should

**      Patient does not have conditions likely terminal for opioid prescribing present
**    Opioid risk benefit assessment has not been performed in the past 90 days
**  Then
**    Regularly Evaluate the Benefits and Risks of Opioid Therapy:
**      Document - Conducted benefit and risk assessment
**      Snooze - Conducted assessment, snooze 3 months
