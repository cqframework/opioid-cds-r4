/*
**
**  Recommendation #6
**    When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than 
**    needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids 
**    (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).
**
**  When
**    Provider is prescribing an opioid analgesic with ambulatory misuse potential in the outpatient setting
**    Prescription is for treating acute pain.
**    Opioid review is useful for this patient:
**      Patient is 18 or over
**      Patient does not have evidence of sickle cell disease
**      Patient does not have findings indicating limited life expectancy
**      Patient does not have orders for therapies indicating end of life care
**      Patient is not undergoing active cancer treatment:
**        Patient has had at least 2 office visits within the past 12 months with an oncology specialist present, or
**        Patient has had at least 2 office visits within the past 12 months with a CDC malignant cancer condition diagnosis
**      Patient does not have conditions likely terminal for opioid prescribing present
**    Prescription is for more than 7 days
**  Then
**    When Treating Acute Pain, Prescribe No Greater Quantity Than Needed:
**      Document - Will adjust opioid order
**      Snooze - Benefits of opioid therapy duration outweigh risks, snooze 3 months
**      Snooze - N/A see comment, snooze 3 months
