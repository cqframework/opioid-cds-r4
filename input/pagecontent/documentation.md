### Pilot Testing Reports

| Guideline Recommendation | Clinical Site | Test Period | Hook Tested |  Functionality Validated | Functionality Not Validated | Comments
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2016 Recommendation 4 | Yale | 2020 | [`patient-view`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/patient-view.html)|Alert when a patient is initiating therapy for chronic pain and an extended release opioid was prescribed instead of an immediate release opioid.||| 
| 2016 Recommendation 10 | Yale | 2020 | [`patient-view`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/patient-view.html)|When a patient was prescribed opioids for chronic pain, and there has not been a urine toxicology screen conducted over the past year, the service issues an alert recommending that a screen be conducted.|||
| 2016 Recommendation 11 | Yale | 2020 | [`patient-view`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/patient-view.html)|Alert when opioids are co-prescribed with benzodiazepines.|||
| 2016 Recommendation 12 | Yale | 2020 | [`patient-view`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/patient-view.html)|Alert is triggered when a patient has been diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the past 90 days and there is no record of the patient receiving OUD treatment.|||
| 2016 Recommendation 10 | Duke | 2020 | [`patient-view`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/patient-view.html)|Alert when opioids are co-prescribed with benzodiazepines.|||
| 2016 Recommendation 11 | Duke | 2020 | [`patient-view`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/patient-view.html)|Alert when opioids are co-prescribed with benzodiazepines.|||
| 2016 Recommendation 10 | Yale | 2021 | [`order-sign`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/order-sign.html)|When signing an order for opioids for chronic pain, the service will alert when there has not been a urine toxicology screen conducted over the past year.|||
| 2016 Recommendation 10 | Yale | 2021 | [`order-sign`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/order-sign.html) (with [suggestion cards](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/index.html#suggestion))|Alert recommending a urine toxicology screen includes a functionality that creates a test order when the alert is accepted.|||
| 2016 Recommendation 10 | Duke | 2021 | [`patient-view`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/patient-view.html)/[`order-sign`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/order-sign.html)/[`order-select`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/order-select.html)|When a patient was prescribed opioids for chronic pain, and there has not been a urine toxicology screen conducted over the past year, the service issues an alert recommending that a screen be conducted, If the patient did have a toxicology test in the past year and tested positive for cocaine or Phencyclidine (PCP) an alert was issued.||Duke tested the service with three different hooks. They learned that the order-select hook was not appropriate for the evaluation because only the medication selected was provided to the service when that hook is triggered. The service required additional ordering information, such as the duration of the order, the quantity, and the frequency of the medication. When Duke configured their electronic health record system (EHR) to create a urine toxicology screen order (as opposed to using a suggestion card), it resulted in a loop when the user accepted the alert. Accepting the alert resulted in an order-sign event that triggered the clinical decision support (CDS) service. The only way to break the alert loop was to decline the recommendation. This was not an issue at Yale.|
| Draft 2022 Recommendation 10 | MUSC | 2022 | [`order-sign`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/order-sign.html)|Validated a base use case of a patient who has not had a toxicology screen in the past year. Also validated alerts for positive results for cocaine, PCP, and opiates.|||
| Draft 2022 Recommendation 11 | MUSC | 2022 | [`order-select`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/order-select.html)|Validate co-prescribing alert both for patients with a pending benzodiazepine order and an existing opioid order, and for patients with a pending opioid order and an existing benzodiazepine order.||Recommendation 11 is an example of an evaluation that fits well with an order-select implementation because the medication selected is the only order information that needs to be known by the service.|
| Draft 2022 Recommendation 8 | Colorado | 2022 | [`order-sign`](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/hooks/order-sign.html)|The morphine milligram equivalent (MME) calculation was disabled in the version of Recommendation 8, which was integration tested. The test case that was validated was co-prescribing with a benzodiazepine. This produced an alert recommending that naloxone be offered to the patient. |Integration testing was conducted for one use case: co-prescribing with a benzodiazepine. Other recommendation conditions, such as history of substance use disorder and an average daily  morphine milligram equivalent (MME) of MME>=50 were not validated. An MME calculation was not conducted as part of this testing.||
