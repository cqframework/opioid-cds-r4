      This section describes the functional behavior of the recommendations as implemented for
      the chosen pilot sites, and documents the process that was used to establish the functional
      behavior once the target recommendations were chosen.
  </p>

  <a name="assumptions"> </a>
  <h3>Assumptions</h3>

  <p>
      Assumptions made in this process were based on team understanding of Epic and Cerner
      EHR capabilities, as well as team experience with clinical decision support (CDS)
      implementation in general, and opioid CDS specifically.
  </p>

  <a name="clinical"> </a>
  <h4>Clinical Assumptions</h4>

  <p>
      Opioids for subacute or chronic pain management are often not started with an intent for chronic use; such
      prescriptions often transition from intended acute pain management. Therefore, it is very difficult
      to identify a new opioid prescription a priori as for subacute or chronic pain management.
  </p>

  <p>Indications and associated diagnoses for opioid prescriptions are often not available within the EHR.</p>

  <p>End dates for opioid prescriptions are often not reliable.</p>

  <a name="tech"> </a>
  <h4>Technical Assumptions</h4>

  <p>The initial focus is on Epic and Cerner EHR platforms.</p>
  <p>
      The technical framework to be used for EHR integration is CDS Hooks, with the FHIR
      Clinical Reasoning Module to represent the behavioral artifacts.
  </p>
  <p>
      Widely scaling this type of CDS is still bleeding-edge clinical informatics work, so
      an iterative and agile approach is recommended.
  </p>
  <p>Both Epic and Cerner will be capable of supporting the provision of the following information:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Opioid medications about to be prescribed</li>
      <li>Problem list, including for cancer</li>
      <li>Prior urine drug testing results</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      The degree to which standard vocabularies are used by Epic and Cerner to provide this
      information must be verified at each implementation site, and to the extent that they are
      not uniform, terminology mappings will need to be established.
  </p>

  <a name="decision"> </a>
  <h3>Decision Points</h3>

  <a name="determination"> </a>
  <h4>Opioid Determination</h4>

  <p>
      The first issue to establish is how to determine what constitutes an opioid. The 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline
      uses NDC codes derived from SAS calculations intended for use against prescription data. Prescription
      data can include ordered medication and/or dispensed medication, depending on availability at the local site.
  </p>

  <p>To avoid excess alerting, the algorithm uses the following exclusions:</p>

  <ol>
      <li>The project team considered excluding liquid opioids altogether, since they may be used for patients with
        life-limited diseases who might be excluded from the recommendations. However, that approach would also exclude
        cough medications which have a significant abuse potential. Therefore, the team excluded only injectable liquid
        forms of opioid and retained oral formulations.</li>
      <li>In some cases, EHR vendors have developed approaches to identify MME equivalents. In such situations, the
          implementation should attempt to match the vendor's approach so that end users receive consistent advice.</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="terminology"> </a>
  <h4>Terminology</h4>

  <p>
  To identify opioids, the IG provides a value set containing RxNorm Semantic
  Clinical Drug (SCD) and Semantic Brand Drug (SBD) concepts which include
  ingredient(s), strength, route and dose form.  The team provides an
  enumerated (extensional) value set. However, a value set with that approach
  quickly becomes outdated as RxNorm updates frequently, or the value set must
  be updated and made available frequently. Therefore, the project team also
  includes an RxNorm query to retrieve all opioids in the
  extended-release/long-acting category and in the immediate-release category.
  Thus, each implementer can update their value sets and run the expressions
  at frequencies appropriate to the organization.  The challenge with using
  queries is that RxNorm retires concepts for medications for which there is no
  input activity (e.g., the NDC code is no longer available). Thus, the output
  of the data retrieved will not include historical drugs for which codes have
  been retired. The impact of missing retired codes for MME calculations is
  likely to be minimal to none since most opioid prescriptions have short
  durations of 30 days or less and codes should be relatively recent.
  </p>

  <a name="ordered-vs-dispensed"> </a>
  <h4>Use of Ordered vs Dispensed Medications</h4>

  <p>
  Medication self-administration data are not available in the ambulatory setting,
  nor would such data be reliable. Therefore, the most proximal information about
  a patient's medication usage is medication dispensed data. Such dispensed data
  is increasingly accessible from claims data available to insurers and used to
  evaluate provider medication utilization rates.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  Researchers can access
  population-based dispensed data from government sources.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Some provider
  organizations also have access to dispensed data for patients treated by their
  clinicians.  The project team considered calculating morphine milligram
  equivalents (MMEs) available to a patient based on medication dispensed data.
  However, since dispensed data are not available to all provider organizations
  and since the pilot site did not have such access, the guidance in this
  implementation guide addresses medication order (prescription) data. Using
  prescription data presented an issue regarding comprehensiveness of the data
  set. While dispensed data are generally available as structured data,
  evaluation of medication order data at the pilot organization showed 20% of
  opioid prescriptions used free-text (unstructured) instructions with over 10,000
   unique patterns. Eliminating such prescriptions from the analysis could
   introduce disproportionate impact of clinical decision support interventions.
   The team built a parsing algorithm to create structured information from 80%
   of the free-text instructions. Clinical review of the parsing results by two,
   independent clinicians confirmed their accuracy. Therefore, the team included
   the parsed data in the MME calculations.
  </p>

  <p>
      For geographic locations with pharmacies that participate in Surescripts, implementation sites have
      the option to use dispense data to perform the MME calculation. However, coverage varies by region,
      and even for regions with coverage, licensing costs may be required and must be considered as a factor
      when determining whether to use dispense data.
  </p>

  <a name="calc"> </a>
  <h4>Calculation of Daily Dosage</h4>

  <p>
      Calculation of daily dosage is based on the prescribed (order) or dispensed data based on expected use
      at the implementation site. The patient may be taking medication less often than prescribed or expected. For
      example, medication ordered every 4 hours as needed (PRN) leads to a calculation of six doses within a 24 hour
      period.
  </p>

  <p>The daily dosage calculation is different based on whether dispsensed data is used:</p>

  <p><strong>Order Data (total daily dose based on the sig)</strong></p>

  <p>Expected use: Total daily dose = quantity per use * strength * daily frequency</p>

  <p>Example: Order for two 24 mg tabs every 4 hours = 2 * 24 mg * 6 = 300 mg per day</p>

  <p><strong>Dispensed Data (dose not use sig)</strong></p>

  <p>Expected use: Total daily dose = (number dispensed * strength) / duration (days)</p>

  <p>Example: Dispensed 60 pills, 25 mg each, for 30 days = (60 * 25) / 30, or 50 mg per day</p>

  <p>
      Actual use may be less per day for a longer time period for either calculation, but the MME calculation addresses
      the prescribed or dispensed data. It is also possible that patients received dispensed medication and failed to
      ingest some or all of it. The extent to which differences exist between actual use and ordered or dispensed data requires
      access to reconciled medication data and may be confounded by trust issues.
  </p>

  <p>
      The National Comittee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
      took a similar approach to determining cumulative medication use over time. The related electronic clinical quality
      measure (eCQM) CMS 128 addresses continuous use of anti-depressant medication management as 84 to 114 days (short term) and
      180 to 231 days (long term) based on active medication and can use prescribed or dispensed data as they are available.
      The eCQM assumes the medication is dispensed and used as written.
  </p>

  <a name="usage"> </a>
  <h4>Determining Opioid Usage</h4>

  <p>
      Active medications in an EHR may have a start date and indicate the number of doses written; however,
      if not discontinued, the algorithm assumes the ordered medication remains active.
  </p>

  <p>The logic assumes the prescription is filled on the day of the order.</p>

  <p>If the prescription includes refills, the system assumes the patient requested all refills of the medication.</p>

  <a name="tolerant-vs-naive"> </a>
  <h4>Opioid-tolerant vs Opioid-naive</h4>

  <p>
  The team considered how to define the concepts opioid-tolerant and opioid-na√Øve.
  Guideline for pain management in adult cancer pain defined these terms as:<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Opioid tolerant:</b> patients who are taking, for 1 week or longer, at least:
      <ul>
        <li>60 mg oral morphine/day;</li>
        <li>25 ¬µg transdermal fentanyl/hour;</li>
        <li>30 mg oral oxycodone/day;</li>
        <li>8 mg oral hydromorphone/day;</li>
        <li>25 mg oral oxymorphone/day; or</li>
        <li>An equianalgesic dose of any other opioid.</li>
      </ul></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Opioid naive:</b> patients who do not meet the above definition of
       opioid tolerant, and who have not taken opioid doses at least as much as
        those listed above for 1 week or longer.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The NCCN v.2010 pain management algorithms also supply simpler definitions for these terms:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Opioid naive:</b> patients who are not chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis; and</li>
          <li><b>Opioid tolerant:</b> patients who are chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis.</li>
        </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  The team was concerned that an opioid-na√Øve patient by the definitions provided
  could have received opioid prescriptions and potentially have an MME of greater
  than 50.  Informing a physician that a patient with an elevated MME is opioid
  na√Øve would lead to confusion. Therefore, the team decided to base
  recommendations on the MME calculation and to avoid categorizing patients as
  opioid tolerant or na√Øve.
  </p>

  <a name="opioid-abuse-assessment"> </a>
  <h4>Opioid Abuse Risk Assessment</h4>

  <p>The project team considered options to determine that a provider has evaluated
    benefits and harms of opioid use.  The implementer needs to determine how the
    local clinicians capture such assessments and map the concept to the SNOMED-CT
    concept: <i>Assessment of risk for opioid abuse (procedure) SCTID: 454281000124100</i>
  </p>

  <p>The team rejected use of the concept <i>At risk for drug therapy problem (finding) (SCTID: 451691000124102)</i>
   as it was too generic as it could address non-opioid medication therapy concerns.
   The team also considered searching for use of patient responses to pain scales as
   evidence that the clinician evaluated patients' responses to opioid use. However,
   pain scales have many uses without concomitant use of opioids and merely evaluating
   pain is not sufficient to assess risk for opioid-related harms. Therefore, the
   guidance does not include pain scale evaluation as a method for determining the
   benefits of opioid use.
 </p>

  <p>To address the recommendation statement ‚Äúoptimize other therapies and work
    with patients to taper opioids to lower dosages or to taper opioids,‚Äù implementers
    should determine what local activities represent such actions and map the activity
    to the SNOMED-CT concept: <i>High risk drug monitoring (regime/therapy): SCTID: 268525008</i>
  </p>

  <p>The project team considered potential benefits of regularly scheduled queries
  to identify the cohort of patients who have been given new prescriptions for
  opioids or prescriptions for escalating doses. Further the analysis of the
  cohort could also determine those for whom assessment of risk or high-risk
  drug monitoring had not occurred at the expected intervals, triggering a
  task list for a clinician role to be determined by the practice. This
  non-synchronous approach is challenged by the fact that CDS Hooks requires
  an event such as opening a record or ordering a mediation as a trigger.
  Since opioid prescriptions have limited number of days supplied,
  patients on continued therapy have encounters with physicians;
  therefore, triggering on the entry of a new prescription order allows
  intervention in a synchronous manner and is equally effective to the
  asynchronous approach to identify patients requiring evaluation and
  monitoring.
  </p>

  <a name="nonmedication"> </a>
  <h4>Information to assist with Non-Medication Terminology Decisions</h4>

  <ul>
      <li>
          Value sets provided include concepts from standardized code systems (e.g., SNOMED-CT, ICD-10-CM, RxNorm) to
          indicate inclusion criteria for a given data element. However, clinicians often document using natural language
          and/or local codes. In addition, some sources only capture billing codes. The implementation site must have a
          mechanism to map such clinician-entered data to the content of the value set to determine if a patient's data
          represents the information required for processing the clinical decision support. Vendors and implementation sites
          may use third party vendors and tools to perform such mappings. The result is a need to create the mappings for
          each guideline valueset based on locally available information. To assure consistency of such translations across
          settings and vendor products requires careful study and analysis. The process also requires effort on the part of
          the EHR, local implementation site, or third party vendor; new value sets must be analyzed and individually
          configured in the system, and existing value sets must be updated regularly to support newly available codes, and
          reviewed for accuracy.
      </li>
      <li>
          Some concepts seem relatively straigthforward when included in a clinical guideline for consumption by a
          clinician. However, when setting up queries to retrieve data from EHR or other clinical software data storage, the
          concepts needed may be difficult to encode using available code systems. Value sets can help with the problem only in
          so far as the concepts are clearly defined without ambiguity. A good example is the definition of end-stage,
          stage 4 or terminal cancer, for exclusion from opiate usage calculation. One approach is to develop a value set
          indicating metastatic cancer and pancreatic cancer. This has the potential of covering the vast majority of cancers
          and secondary malignant neoplastic disease. Avoiding primary neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease seems prudent
          as these diagnoses are less likely to identify patients for whom the opportunity for additional treatment and
          quality of life has passed. However, successfully identifying patients for whom opiate medications should be ignored
          might better be managed by using encounter location or type to identify patients assigned to hospice care, e.g.
          <ul>
              <li>Procedures
                  <ol>
                      <li>Referral to hospice (procedure) SCTID : 306205009</li>
                      <li>Admission to hospice (procedure) SCTID: 305336008</li>
                      <li>Urgent admission to hospice (procedure) SCTID: 183919006</li>
                      <li>Discharge to healthcare facility for hospice care (procedure) SCTID: 428371000124100</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Findings
                  <ol>
                      <li>Full care by hospice (finding) SCTID: 170935008</li>
                      <li>Transition from self-care to hospice (finding) SCTID: 448451000124101</li>
                      <li>Transition from acute care to hospice (finding) SCTID: 1891000124102</li>
                      <li>Transition from long-term care to hospice (finding) SCTID: 1951000124104</li>
                      <li>Transition from long-term care to hospice (finding) SCTID: 1951000124104</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Regime/therapy:
                  <ol>
                      <li>Dying care (regime/therapy) SCTID: 385736008</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
          </ul>
          Because it is so difficult to identify individual patients who are appropriately receiving high opioid doses,
          it is important to allow the physician to override the alert with a reason, e.g., to indicate end-of-life care.
          Since the override option has the potential of over alerting, a mechanism to determine end-of-life care as provided
          using hospice care seem preferable.
