Determining whether a patient is being prescribed opioids for acute pain is difficult to determine by examination of the medical record alone. The project team identified the following proxies for acute pain, used throughout the recommendations:

1. A medication is considered for acute pain if it is being prescribed for less than 28 days.

1. A medication is considered for acute pain if it has a therapy type of "acute".
