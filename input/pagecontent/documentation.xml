    This section contains documentation for implementers from both the clinical and technical
    perspectives. The process documentation describes the assumptions and decisions made, as well
    as a functional description of the recommendations. The integration documentation describes the
    overall approach and documents the artifacts contained in the IG, while the implementation
    documentation provides developer-level documentation on how to use the artifacts.
