**
**  Recommendation #9
**    When prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically 
**    during opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should review the patientâ€™s history of 
**    controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data 
**    to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient 
**    at high risk for overdose (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).
**
**  When
**    Provider is prescribing an opioid analgesic with ambulatory misuse potential in the outpatient setting
**    CDC 2022 guideline general inclusion criteria met for this patient:
**      Patient is 18 or over
**      Patient does not have evidence of sickle cell disease
**      Patient does not have findings indicating limited life expectancy
**      Patient does not have orders for therapies indicating end of life care
**      Patient is not undergoing active cancer treatment:
**        Patient has had at least 2 office visits within the past 12 months with an oncology specialist present, or
**        Patient has had at least 2 office visits within the past 12 months with a CDC malignant cancer condition diagnosis
**      Patient does not have conditions likely terminal for opioid prescribing present
**    PDMP data has not been reviewed in the past 90 days or
**    PDMP review procedure has not been performed in the past 90 days
**  Then
**    Before Ordering Opioids, Review PDMP Data:
**      Access Data - Launch app to review PDMP data
**      Document - PDMP data reviewed, snooze 3 months
**      Snooze - N/A see comment, snooze 3 months
