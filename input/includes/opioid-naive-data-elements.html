      1 - Implement one global configuration point to set all past medication queries at each particular site: “Can the
      implementing EHR support queries for past medications by date range? Yes or No”. An evaluation to determine if a patient
      is opioid naive is not possible when a EHR system does not support queries for past medications by date range. <br />
      2 - orders use RxNorm, but medication lists and dispensed medication will require an NDC value set and/or local mapping
      of NDC to RxNorm to enable this element</td>
