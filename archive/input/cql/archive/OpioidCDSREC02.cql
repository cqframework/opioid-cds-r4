**
**  Recommendation #2
**    Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should maximize 
**    use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific 
**    condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for 
**    pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before starting opioid 
**    therapy for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic 
**    benefits and known risks of opioid therapy, should work with patients to establish treatment 
**    goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if 
**    benefits do not outweigh risks (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 2).
**
**  When
**    Provider is prescribing an opioid with ambulatory misuse potential in the outpatient setting
**    Prescription is for treating subacute and/or chronic pain.
**    Opioid review is useful for this patient:
**      Patient is 18 or over
**      Patient does not have evidence of sickle cell disease
**      Patient does not have findings indicating limited life expectancy
**      Patient does not have orders for therapies indicating end of life care
**      Patient is not undergoing active cancer treatment:
**        Patient has had at least 2 office visits within the past 12 months with an oncology specialist present, or
**        Patient has had at least 2 office visits within the past 12 months with a CDC malignant cancer condition diagnosis
**      Patient does not have conditions likely terminal for opioid prescribing present
**    Patient is opioid naive:
**      No indication of opioid use in the past 90 days from a prescription, self report (for future implementation), or a dispensing event (for future implementation)
**    Pain management procedure in past 90 days is not present and
**    Pain treatment plan created, edited, or reviewed by the prescribing physician in past 90 days is not present
**  Then
**    Maximize Nonopioid Therapies as Appropriate:
**      Document - Collaborated with patient to identify treatment goals
**      Snooze - Attempting alternate therapy, snooze 3 months
**      Order - Select alternative therapies from order select
**      Snooze - N/A see comment, snooze 3 months
**      Remove - Will remove triggering medication order
